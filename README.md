### Hi there 👋

# As the Senior Developer Advocate at Equinix, I help create video and written how-to guides, product demos, and reference materials. Having been a broadcast engineer at Youtube Space LA, I understand online content and production and am excited to bring that energy to Equinix’s growing community across all sites, meetups, and events.

🌱 I’m currently on a path towards to become a Certified Kubernetes Administrator.

🔭 I’m currently working on Equinix Docs and Guthub Workflows.
